Profit Maximum Companies

Biweekly/weekly/quarterly profit max/cap vote

even distribution of cryptocurrency to all participants of company holding an account with them

repeat

How are the voting numbers calculated? there are always 3 voting options

take 4 variables (total/gross sales,Profit/Income,previous amount distributed to particpants,previous winning voting number)(Earnings sheet)

order them from least to greatest in number

|------|------|------|

least             greatest

the median between each number are the options( 3 total )

to begin, previous amount distributed to particpants(0) and previous winning votng number(0)

number earned over voted profit max(biweekly/weekly) gets divided equaly and evenly to each participant of the company

Money earned over voted profit max(biweekly/weekly) gets directly injected into products or services that participants can buy with their cryptocurrency.

Above is the algorithm without structure. There are downsides to having companies solely adopt this algorithmic philosphy.

One is falsely reporting company earnings report
(infalting or deflating certain company metrics to improve or influence UBI)


What is the solution?



- a website everyone owns yet no one owns
    this website gets built secure by top 50 tech companies and the NSA so that it cannot be hacked for atleast hundreds if not thousands of years.
    theres nothing we cant do if we come together. This website is built and designed for voting on companies profit maximum and also proposing and voting on laws for companies and society.
    (needs a really cool design). UBI should be able to consistently cover food and shelter at minimum. with this site people are in control so that they can check and balance companies.
    (organized and devloped live with all in attendance in like a stadium or something with a live chat where problems can be heard and solved)

- a declration of freedom
    This is a declration signed by the top 50 or so tech companies agreeing to indefintely abide by the laws and regulations voted on and proposed by the people and the system itself.
    (signed live with all in attendance in like a stadium or something )
    
   heres the code for my companies attempted implemtaton of Utopyism with python and Flask.
   a practical example
